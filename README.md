## Neural-Style-Transfer
### Helper Functions
#### Load Image, Save Image, Plot Images
### Define Loss functions
#### Mean squared error loss, Content loss, Style Loss
### Gram Matrix
#### To capture the features of the style image i.e to measure the features that activate for the style layers. Gram matrix is essentially the dot product for the vectors of the feature activation layers
### Denoise Loss
#### To reduce the noise in the resultant mixed image, we use a denoising filtering algorithm called ‘Total Variation Denoising’.
### Style Transfer Algorithm
#### Calculates the gradient descent on the loss functions
